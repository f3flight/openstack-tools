rbd-loc.sh, rbd-loc-fast.sh - locate image's objects inside CEPH pool. Usage: `./rbd-loc-fast.sh <pool> <object-name>`. "Fast" version works faster by not using `rados ls` but can become incompatible if object naming convention changes and also may not work for very small images which consist of only one object (not tested).
deep-scrub-pgs-per-hour-history.sh - show recent history of deep scrubs in the cluster, sorted and grouped by 1 hour. Number on the left is the count of PGs deep scrubbed during that hour. Useful for analysis of deep scrub's impact on cluster performance.
